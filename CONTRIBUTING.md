  - have any other questions/proposals you'd like to put to the dev team
- please be patient with our response, as most of us are only working on this in our spare time
- If you like to find out more about what everyone is working on, please come to our weekly Wednesday evening catchups to meet the team! Please ask on [#civic-makers-climatechange](https://app.slack.com/client/T02A8KY38/C01CXCQPF8V) slack channel to get an invite.
- Some of the dev folk will usually hang around after the catchup to discuss on outstanding issues and do some remote pair/mob programming. But if the timing doesn't work for you, don't fret, please ask on [#civic-makers-climatechange-dev](https://app.slack.com/client/T02A8KY38/C01DALXS62K) to arrange a more suitable time to pair!
